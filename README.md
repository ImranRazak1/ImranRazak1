Hello ðŸ‘‹, 
-- 

Iâ€™ve always been a curious person, and Iâ€™ve always had a passion for learning. So, when I found out that iOS Development was my calling, I wasnâ€™t surprised.

But what did surprise me was how much work it would take to get to where I am now. It wasnâ€™t easyâ€”in fact, it took me years of effort before I could call myself an iOS Engineer.

But now that I have the skills I need, there are so many different directions I can take my career. And as every year passes, new technologies emerge that make it possible for us to do things that never would have been possible before. This is just one of those times where technology has come together in such a way that it makes our jobs easier and more exciting than ever before!


Some Highlights of my Skills:
--

- xCode
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- UIKit
- UICollectionViews
- AWS S3

# Interests
### UI/UX Design
Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Using Figma and Sketch I can design great interfaces built with the user in mind.

### iOS Programming
UICollection Views, UIKit, SwiftUI and Xcode. I am continuously learning new frameworks in new projects. 

### Collaboration
Learning to adapt and communicate across teams but also within a team. And working remotely using software like Slack, Webex and JIRA.

### Creative Leader
Solving problems, thinking outside the box and make string everyone is apart of the team effort.


### Problem Solving
Working on problems sometimes means take a break from it to look at it from a different perspective. The consistency to keep learning like Thomas Edison did until you get right.


### Git/Github.
Version control using Github from Xcode.

### iOS/iPad/Mac
An avid Apple user who can utilise my skill to get around the eco-system quite easily and without a fuss.

### Customer Centric
Working with customers for so many years has given me a depth of experience that I can bring to a new workplace to always think like the customer and to keep innovating as such based on their needs rather than wants.
